# Project FADAIG: For Absolutely Destroying An iMessage Game

> a.k.a. The Word Hunt Bot

There's actually much more potential for this than just a word hunt bot. The code published here is published in case anyone would find it useful for their own projects. See [here](#license) for license.

## Parts required

- [Arduino Leonardo](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo)
- [Serial-to-USB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BBPX8B8)
- [Jumper wires](https://amazon.com/dp/B01EV70C78)
- A micro-USB to USB cable/adapter for connecting the Arduino Leonardo's factory USB port to your host device and/or target device

## Usage

1. Install the `src/worker` code onto the Arduino Leonardo
2. Install the `src/controller` code onto the host device
3. Connect the Arduino Leonardo's factory USB to the target device
4. Connect the serial-to-usb cable
   - Connect the respective `RX`, `TX`, and `GND` pins (`RX`->`TXD`, `TX`->`RXD`, `GND`->`GND`)
   - Connect the other end of the serial-to-usb to the host device
5. Run the `src/controller` code on the host device
   1. Start running the code on the host device
   2. Press "start" on target device
   3. Confirm program execution on host device after animation finished
   4. Input board
   5. Profit
